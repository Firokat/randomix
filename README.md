## Introduction
This is an open source app created to experiment some new android features, but it's also available on Play Store for all users.
The main purpose of the app is provide a **random choice** in different ways. The app contains some basic personalization options and an introduction, plus some new resources like **animated vector drawables** and full light theme. The design is a bit personal, it follows the guidelines just partially.

  - **Roulette** -> chooses between a specified number of options, entered from the user.
  - **Coin** -> simply flips a coin and prints the result.
  - **Dice** -> throws a dice and prints the result.
  - **Magic Ball** -> provides randomly chosen answers to any question.
- Light and dark themes (Android 10 dark mode supported)
- Selectable accent (no app restart needed)
- Multiwindows support
- First time introduction (Appintro)
- Simple and precise ui (androidx)
- Sounds, vibration and other options
- Small size (~3MB), optimized code
