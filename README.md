This is an open source app created to experiment some new android features, but it's also available on Play Store and F-Droid for all users.
The main purpose of the app is provide a **random choice** in different ways. The app contains some basic personalization options and an introduction, plus some new resources like **animated vector drawables** and full light theme.
